### `Prettier`
`One of the main advantages of using Prettier in your React app is that it helps to automatically format your code. This means that you don't have to spend time manually formatting `
`your code, which can be a tedious task, especially in large projects. Instead, you can focus on writing code and let Prettier handle the formatting.`

`Another advantage of Prettier is its seamless integration with code editors like Visual Studio Code. Once you have installed the Prettier extension in Visual Studio Code, you can easily format your code with a simple command from the command palette or even configure it to format on save. This means every time you save your file, your code gets automatically formatted according to the rules defined in your configuration file.`
